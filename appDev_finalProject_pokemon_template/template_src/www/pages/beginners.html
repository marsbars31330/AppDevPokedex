</div>

        <div class="content">
          <p>Pokemon Go is fairly simple to start playing, and the basic structure of the game is very easy to understand and get to grips with. All you have to do is create a character and then begin searching for Pokemon in the real world. You use the map (which represents your local surroundings) to track down Pokemon which you then catch using pokeballs. Once you’ve caught a range of Pokemon you can begin using them for battles. It’s not dissimilar to the main Game Boy, DS and 3DS games in this regard, albeit simplified in its battles. With that said, we’ve got some basic, essential tips for you to consider as you begin your Pokemon Go quest:
            <p>

          <h4>Be prepared to move</h4>
          <p>This might seem obvious, but Pokemon Go really does require you to move around – and a lot. Before you even start, you should know that if you want to get serious about Pokemon Go you’ll have to carry it with you often and even make an effort to travel to parks and similar places to make the most of in-game events. You can’t play this from home, and if you try you’ll be disappointed.
          </p>

          <h4>Choose your gym team wisely – it’s a one-time deal</h4>
          <p>Once you hit trainer level 5 you’ll be faced with a choice between three different gym factions: the yellow Team Instinct, the blue Team Mystic and the red Team Valor. Choose carefully, as once the decision is made, it can’t be undone – other than by deleting your account and standing over… which you obviously don’t want to do. Ultimately the choice doesn’t impact anything in a major way, though.
          </p>

          <h4>Turn on battery saver mode</h4>
          <p>This advice is key: turn on the battery saver mode. To do this, tap the Pokeball at the bottom of the screen to see the options menu, then hit the settings cog icon in the top right. The option to enable battery saver is in there. When this mode is enabled your phone will preserve battery when it’s not held in a position where you’d be looking at it, like pointed towards the floor. Short of picking up a Pokemon Go Plus it’s the most economical way of playing the game battery-wise.
          </p>

          <h4>Wild Pokemon improve with your character level</h4>
          <p>Early on you may be wondering why all the Pokemon nearby are weak. This is by design: Pokemon in the wild will get better as you do. Your trainer level determines what’s around, and you’ll see rarer, more powerful or late evolution creatures as you level up. Keep leveling yourself up to boost the types of Pokemon you find available to catch.
          </p>

          <h4>There’s more to Pokemon battling and stats than meets the eye</h4>
          <p>Behind-the-scenes, Pokemon Go is just as complicated as the main Pokemon games, with deep stats-based systems that determine Pokemon strength. No two Pokemon are the same, and the CP (Combat Points) of a Pokemon are only a general indicator of its strength. Keep that in mind when choosing your favorite Pokemon, and if you want to get into the deep side of things, there’s some reading for you linked further down this page.
