        <div class="title">Pokémon Go: How to catch rare Pokémon</div>

        <div class="content">
          <p>Pokémon Go's slogan is "gotta catch 'em all" and that's exactly what a large part of the game play involves. You travel around, Pokémon pop up all around you, and you try to catch them. All of them. Then, of course, there are also Raids! They're tougher and some of them are super rare as well.
            So, how do you catch them all?<p>

          <h4>TL;DR: Give me the highlights?</h4>
          <p>If you don't want the details — though you really should read them at least once! — here's a quick cheat sheet!</p>
            <ol>
                <li>ABC. Always be curving. Once you can nail Curve Ball every time, you'll get a 1.7x bonus every time.</li>
                <li>Max out your medals. Some are easier to get than others but they consume no resources like Great or Ultra Balls or Razz Berries, so once you get them, that 1.1x to 1.3x is automatically applied each time.</li>
                <li>Consistency counts. Aim for the smallest target you can nail every time. If that's Nice, it's nice. If that's Great or Excellent, even nicer. But better the bonus you get then one you miss, and that extra 1.3 to 2x also doesn't consume resources and can make a difference.</li>
                <li>Razz for real. Use Razz Berries when you need to. Unlike Great or Ultra Balls, you can't miss with a Razz Berry and its 1.5x bonus will last until you hit. For Golden Razz Berries, it's 2.5x!</li>
                <li>Bump them Balls. Use Great and Ultra Balls to maximize your odds. You get an extra 1.5x for a Great Ball and 2x for an Ultra Ball so use them to get those super rare or hard to catch Pokémon.</li>
                <li>Pinap Power: Use a Pinap Berry to get double Candy for any Pokémon you really want to evolve or power up. You can't use a Razz Berry as well, so use an Ultra Ball to make up the difference.</li>
                <li>Nanab ain't nothing: Ostensible a Nanab Berry calms a Pokémon down, making it easier to hit. In the current game, though, it seems to make little to no real difference</li>
