        <div class="title">Pokemon Go raids: How raids work and tips for completing them</div>

        <div class="content">
          <p>If you haven't done any Pokemon Go raids yet and you're not even sure what they are, fear not. Raid bosses in Pokemon Go are essentially oversized regular Pokemon that you can team up with friends to take down. Some of them are easy to defeat, but for others, you'll need to bring along a group of pals to even stand a chance.
            Pokemon Go raid bosses can be the only way to obtain certain Pokemon in Pokemon Go, so even if you don't partake in them frequently, it's useful to know how they work if the opportunity arises
            <p>
          <h4>How to do a Pokemon Go raid</h4>
          <p>Pokemon Go raids are found exclusively at gyms, which are the much taller Pokestops you'll see in towns and cities. No matter which team has control of a gym, anyone can partake in a raid when it appears, indicated by a coloured egg on top. This will be accompanied by a timer, counting down from one hour, so Pokemon Go communities have enough preparation time to get players together to take it down.
            Tapping on the egg icon in the corner, while looking at the gym, will reveal how difficult it is. The amount of monster faces above the egg represents the level of the gym, as does the colour. Level one and two raids will always be pink, level three and four raids are yellow, while level five raids are purple with white stripes.
            To do the Pokemon Go raid, you simply have to be at the respective gym within the 45 minutes after the egg hatches. As long as you have a Raid Pass - which is given out for free once per day at your first Gym PokeStop spin of the day - you can have a shot at taking down the raid boss. If you want to do more than one raid per day, you can pick up Premium Raid Passes from the in-game store for 100 coins apiece.

          <h4>Pokemon Go Raid tips </h4>
          <p>If you see a level five raid but you don't have at least a few other players to tackle it with, forget it. Solo players can stick to level one and two raids reliably, as these raid bosses will rarely put up much of a fight. They have low health and as long as you've surpassed around level 20, you'll be able to defeat them with ease by yourself.
            Level three raids are where things start to get tricky, and if you're playing solo you'll need to consider preparing some counters to the Pokemon raid boss you'll be fighting. If there's a few of you fighting together though, then you shouldn't have much of an issue, especially if you've all reached level 30 or higher.
            For the level four and five raids, you need to enlist the help of a few buddies. These raids can range from 20,000 boss CP to 50,000, and you will not be able to complete them solo. This is where you'll be able to catch legendary Pokemon and other exclusives, depending on which Pokemon are in the current raid pool.
            Make sure you stock up on potions and learn the counters for whichever Pokemon Go raid boss you're up against, so you can create your party appropriately. If you don't have any strong counters, go for some all round versatile beasts; Tyranitar and Dragonite are two good examples. Best of luck!
