          <p>Pokemon Go evolution items have been around since the start of the game, as they're required to evolve certain Pokemon and complete the Pokedex. From the original evolution items in Pokemon Go like the Metal Coat to the more recent introductions such as the Unova Stone, we've got all of the Pokemon Go evolution items covered right here.

          <h4>How to get evolution items in Pokemon Go</h4>
          <p>Now, I don’t want to sound like a nagging Poke-parent - ironic given how lax parents are in the main games - but it’s time to up your game and start playing Pokemon Go every day. Yep, on your feet soldier. If you aren’t already, this small step will guarantee you a Pokemon Go evolution item every seven days from your seven day Pokestop streak and increase your odds of finding a Sinnoh Stone.
            Regular special items such as Up-Grades and King’s Rocks sometimes even drop from regular Poke Stops but making sure to spin a Poke Stop every day and working towards your streak will ensure you get at least one every week. Bear in mind though that it’s impossible to predict what you’ll get so you might have to see a few Metal Coats before you find the Sun Stone you want.
            The Sinnoh Stone, introduced with Gen 4, is a significantly trickier find but not impossible. There are two main ways to find a Sinnoh Stone. The first is to complete your seven day research breakthrough tasks. This essentially means earning one stamp each day until you earn a legendary Pokemon encounter. If you’re lucky, at the same time, you’ll earn a Sinnoh Stone but they are not guaranteed. The second way to find one is to take part in trainer battles via PvP. Sinnoh Stones have been known to drop for both winners and losers. Good luck!

          <img style="width: 100%;" src="./img/tips_pages/exev2.png">
          <p>If you’ve spun a Pokestop for the seventh day in a row or finished your weekly research breakthrough task and found a brand new shiny thing you’ve never seen before, you can say hello to your first Pokemon Go evolution item. You might even have a few you don’t know you have, so pop into your items list and have a quick scroll.
            Evolution items were introduced with the Gen 2 update all the way back in 2017 and mean a whole stack of new ‘mon via evolution if you hoard your candy just right. So far, we’ve only got one fourth generation item, the Sinnoh Stone, but you’re going to need it for a stack of 4th generation Pokemon evolutions. More on that below but the current evolution items are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Dragon Scale</li>
              <li>King’s Rock</li>
              <li>Metal Coat</li>
